This project was a simple one, trying to utilize the powers of web scraping. 

What my program does is that it grabs all the teachers and their related courses and then organizes it into a csv file. 
Then people can simply look at the course, then see which teachers teach it, and their related websites!

To use, make sure you have python3 downloaded.
Then download the entire folder and cd into that folder.

Simply install all the requirements, 

pip3 install requirements.txt

Then run it with 
python3 run.py

The web scraper that I am using is the requests-html library. 

The classes.csv is an example of one of the sites scraped, and the html file is to help see how each one was built, so that it can be scraped.
